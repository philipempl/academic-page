summary: "The 17th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2022), will be held from August 23 to August 26, 2022. The International IFIP Cross Domain Conference for Machine Learning & Knowledge Extraction (CD-MAKE) will be co-located with ARES 2022!. The International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES) brings together researchers and practitioners in the field of IT security & privacy.Since 2005, ARES serves as an important platform to exchange, discuss and transfer knowledge and is hosted every year in another European city."
abstract: "As more and more security tools provide organizations with cybersecurity capabilities, security analysts are overwhelmed by security events. Resolving these events is challenging due to extensive manual processes, limited financial resources, and human errors. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) is an established approach to manage security tools and assets. However, SOAR platforms typically integrate traditional IT systems only. Additional considerations are required to deal with the Internet of Things (IoT), its multiple devices and complex networks. Therefore, we adapt SOAR to IoT. We first aggregate existing research and information on SOAR and SOAR platforms. We envision the SOAR4IoT framework, making IoT assets manageable for SOAR via middleware. We implement a prototypical digital twin-based SOAR application integrating IoT assets and security tools to validate our framework. The experimental setup includes two playbooks coping with Mirai and Sybil attacks. Results show feasibility as our SOAR application enables securing IoT assets with digital twins."
