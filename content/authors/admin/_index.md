Hello! I'm Philip, an enthusiast in the realm of Operational Technology (OT) security. My journey began at the University of Regensburg, where I earned a Master's in Management Information Systems in 2020. But that was just the beginning. As a research assistant pursuing my Ph.D. with the University's Chair of Information Systems, I've delved deep into the intricacies of Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity.
But my vision extends beyond research. As the Chief Technology Officer at MPS Intelligence Solution, I'm at the forefront of designing and developing cutting-edge OT security solutions. My goal? To ensure that these innovations not only set new standards in security but also align seamlessly with legal and regulatory frameworks. This is more than a job for me â€“ it's a commitment to redefine and elevate OT security in the years to come.
